# Arbi Bridge Documentation

## Overview

The Arbi Bridge contract serves as a critical component in enabling secure and efficient communication between different layers of a blockchain network. It manages the processing of messages, escrow associated with transactions, and facilitates seamless cross-layer interactions.

## Key Features

### 1. **Sequencer Operations**
   - Enqueue sequencer messages and submit batch spending reports.
   - Maintain sequencer inbox accumulators for secure message processing.

### 2. **Delayed Message Handling**
   - Enqueue delayed messages from allowed inboxes.
   - Update the delayed inbox accumulator to track message history.

### 3. **External Call Execution**
   - Execute external calls from allowed outboxes.
   - Record transaction details for cross-layer transactions.

### 4. **Configuration Management**
   - Set the sequencer inbox and manage allowed delayed inboxes and outboxes.
   - Dynamically configure the contract to adapt to changing network requirements.

### 5. **Status Queries**
   - Retrieve information about the active outbox, allowed inboxes and outboxes.
   - Obtain counts of delayed and sequencer messages for status monitoring.

## Internal Functions

The internal functions of the Arbi Bridge contract are designed to handle critical processes such as enqueuing messages, executing external calls, and managing the contract's configuration. These functions ensure the seamless operation of the bridge and the integrity of cross-layer transactions.

## Events

The contract emits the following events to provide transparency and facilitate monitoring:

- `MessageDelivered(...)`: Emits details about the delivery of a message, capturing execution specifics and related information.
- `BridgeCallTriggered(...)`: Signals the triggering of a bridge call, providing insights into the executed call.

## Security Considerations

The Arbi Bridge contract prioritizes security with measures such as access controls, permission validations, and integrity checks. It ensures that only authorized entities, including the sequencer and approved inboxes/outboxes, can interact with the contract. The dynamic configuration capabilities enhance adaptability to evolving security needs.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the Arbi Bridge contract is a crucial infrastructure component, fostering interoperability between different layers of a blockchain network. Its robust features, internal functions, and security considerations collectively contribute to the secure and efficient execution of cross-layer transactions, elevating the overall network functionality. Developers can leverage the Arbi Bridge to enhance communication and coordination across diverse blockchain layers.
