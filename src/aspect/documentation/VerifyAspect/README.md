### Contract Aspect Structure on Artela Blockchain

Here's a summary of the Aspect structure for the provided contract:

### 1. Initialization:
- Set up a new project with Node.js and npm.
- Use the `aspect-tool` to initialize a new project, creating the recommended directory structure and configuration files.

### 2. Project Structure:
- Directories for aspects, smart contracts, utility scripts, tests, and configuration files.

### 3. Creating a Contract Aspect:
- Contract Aspect is implemented as the TypeScript class `Aspect`.
- Implements the `ITransactionVerifier` interface, indicating it's a Transaction-Level Aspect.

### 4. Aspect Implementation:
- The `verifyTx` method is part of the `ITransactionVerifier` interface and is triggered whenever there is a transaction calling the bound smart contract.
- The `isOwner` method is a governance check invoked during governance operations (upgrade, config, destroy).

### 5. Registration of Aspect:
- An instance of the `Aspect` class is created (`const aspect = new Aspect();`).
- The Aspect instance is registered with the entry point (`entryPoint.setAspect(aspect);`).

### 6. Export Entry Point:
- An entry point function is exported (`export { execute, allocate };`).
- This function is called when a message is sent to the Aspect-Runtime.

### 7. Tool Recommendation:
- It is recommended to use the `@artela/aspect-tool` for additional features like deployment, binding, and calls.

### Summary:

- **Aspect Definition:**
  - The `Aspect` class implements the `ITransactionVerifier` interface, making it a Transaction-Level Aspect.

- **Verification Logic:**
  - The `verifyTx` method contains logic triggered on every transaction, fetching data from the Artela Aspect system.

- **Governance Check:**
  - The `isOwner` method implements a governance check, ensuring the initiator of governance operations has the necessary permission.

- **Aspect Registration:**
  - An instance of the `Aspect` class is registered with the entry point to make it operational.

- **Compilation:**
  - WebAssembly bytecode is generated by compiling the AssemblyScript sources.

- **Tool Recommendation:**
  - For additional features like deployment, binding, and calls, it is recommended to use the `@artela/aspect-tool`. It seamlessly integrates with the Artela Blockchain.

- **Communication with Blockchain:**
  - External tools like web3.js are suggested for communication with the Artela Blockchain, as AssemblyScript projects may lack certain blockchain interaction features. The `@artela/aspect-tool` is recommended for these tasks.
