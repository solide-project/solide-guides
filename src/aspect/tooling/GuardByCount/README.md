# GuardByCountAspect: Strengthening Security in Artela Smart Contracts

## Overview

The `GuardByCountAspect` contract, seamlessly integrated into the Artela blockchain, empowers smart contract developers with enhanced security measures against potential reentrancy attacks. Leveraging the `IPostContractCallJP` and `IPreContractCallJP` interfaces, this Aspect introduces ownership validation, ensuring that only authorized entities execute operations. Its key feature lies in the implementation of a call count mechanism, stored in transient storage, to detect and prevent reentrancy attacks. By marking transactions as failed when the call count exceeds 1, the Aspect fortifies smart contracts against multiple inner transaction calls, contributing to a more secure and resilient decentralized application (DApp) environment.

## Ownership Validation

The `GuardByCountAspect` begins by validating ownership, allowing only authorized entities to execute operations on the smart contract. This ensures that transactions are initiated by legitimate owners, adding an essential layer of security.

## Call Count Mechanism

A distinctive feature of this Aspect is its implementation of a call count mechanism within the `IPreContractCallJP` and `IPostContractCallJP` joints. The Aspect keeps track of the number of inner transaction calls through a context-specific key in transient storage. During the pre-contract call phase, it increments the call count, and in the post-contract call phase, it checks if the count exceeds 1. If multiple inner transaction calls are detected, the transaction is marked as failed, preventing potential reentrancy attacks.

## Seamless Integration

Implementing the `GuardByCountAspect` is seamless for developers, requiring the registration of the Aspect instance using the `entryPoint.setAspect` method. This integration equips developers with a powerful tool to enhance the security of Artela blockchain-based DApps.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the `GuardByCountAspect` contract stands as a pivotal addition to the Artela blockchain, providing developers with a robust solution to mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities. By combining ownership validation and a call count mechanism, it ensures that smart contracts operate in a secure and controlled manner. As developers leverage this Aspect, the Artela blockchain continues to foster a trustworthy and resilient ecosystem for decentralized applications.
