# StoreAspect Contract: Enhancing Smart Contract Functionality

The `StoreAspect` contract is a crucial component of the Artela blockchain ecosystem, designed to enhance the functionality and reliability of smart contracts by introducing advanced features through the Aspect Programming paradigm. This Aspect, executed on the Aspect-Runtime using WebAssembly, plays a pivotal role in various stages of smart contract execution, including pre and post-transaction phases and before and after contract calls.

## Ownership Verification
The `StoreAspect` implements the `isOwner` method, which ensures that only the rightful owner, identified by the Ethereum address, can execute certain operations. This ownership verification adds an additional layer of security to smart contracts, preventing unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities.

## Transaction Lifecycle
In the `preTxExecute` method, the Aspect interacts with the transient storage, setting a key-value pair (`'aspectSetKey': 'HelloWord'`) during the pre-transaction execution phase. This capability allows developers to manipulate the transaction context before it is committed to the blockchain, offering flexibility in modifying transaction parameters.

The `postTxExecute` method demonstrates the retrieval of data from the transient storage during the post-transaction execution phase. This feature enables smart contracts to store and retrieve information persistently across transaction executions, contributing to the maintenance of stateful behavior.

## Contract Call Interaction
For interactions during contract calls, the `preContractCall` method showcases the manipulation of mutable state. In this case, the Aspect increments the value associated with the key `'state-key'` before the contract call, providing developers with the ability to modify the contract's state dynamically before the contract logic is executed.

The `postContractCall` method illustrates the reading of mutable state after the contract call, emphasizing the Aspect's role in observing and interacting with the smart contract's state changes during its lifecycle.

Overall, the `StoreAspect` contract enriches smart contract development on Artela by offering ownership verification, transaction context manipulation, and insightful interactions with the contract state. Developers can leverage these capabilities to build secure, flexible, and stateful decentralized applications, thereby contributing to the robustness and reliability of the Artela blockchain ecosystem.
