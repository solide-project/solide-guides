# Overview: GeomeanOracle Smart Contract

## Overview

The GeomeanOracle smart contract is designed to function as a Uniswap V4-compatible oracle, offering time-weighted average prices (TWAPs) using a geomean calculation method. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understand the purpose, features, and implementation of the GeomeanOracle contract.

## Key Features

### 1. Geomean Oracle

The contract implements the geomean method for TWAP calculations, ensuring that the provided price data is reliable, resistant to manipulation, and suitable for various decentralized finance protocols.

### 2. Observation Management

GeomeanOracle manages an extensive array of price and liquidity observations, enabling precise TWAP calculations. This feature ensures that the oracle produces accurate and up-to-date price information for the specified token pairs.

### 3. Liquidity Lock

To maintain consistent and secure price data, the contract includes a Liquidity Lock feature. This ensures that liquidity within oracle pools remains permanently locked, preventing potential vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of the oracle.

### 4. Single Oracle Pool Restriction

The contract restricts each token pair to a single oracle pool, reducing fragmentation and maintaining a unified source of price data. This restriction enhances the reliability of the oracle and simplifies the management of price information for specific token pairs.

### 5. Cardinality Management

GeomeanOracle allows for the adjustment of the observation array cardinality, providing flexibility to accommodate more frequent price updates. This feature ensures adaptability to changing market conditions and diverse protocol requirements.

## Internal Functions

### 1. `getObservation`

- Retrieves a specific observation for a pool based on the provided pool key and index.

### 2. `getState`

- Obtains the current state of observations for a pool using the pool key.

### 3. `observe`

- Calculates TWAPs using the specified timestamps for a given pool.

### 4. `increaseCardinalityNext`

- Updates the cardinality next value to accommodate a larger number of observations.

## Events

No custom events are emitted by the GeomeanOracle contract itself. The contract relies on existing Uniswap V4-core and periphery libraries for event handling.

## Security Considerations

### 1. OnlyOneOraclePoolAllowed Exception

The `OnlyOneOraclePoolAllowed` exception ensures that there is only one oracle pool allowed per token pair, preventing potential inconsistencies and maintaining a standardized source of price data.

### 2. OraclePositionsMustBeFullRange Exception

The `OraclePositionsMustBeFullRange` exception enforces that oracle positions cover the full range of ticks. This security measure ensures that the oracle operates within a specified tick range, minimizing the risk of inaccurate price calculations.

### 3. OraclePoolMustLockLiquidity Exception

The `OraclePoolMustLockLiquidity` exception prevents liquidity removal from oracle pools, enhancing the security of the oracle by maintaining locked liquidity and reducing susceptibility to potential exploits.

## Conclusion

The GeomeanOracle smart contract offers a robust solution for obtaining secure and manipulation-resistant time-weighted average prices in the Uniswap V4 ecosystem. Its key features, including geomean-based TWAP calculations, single oracle pool restriction, and liquidity lock, contribute to the reliability and integrity of price data. GeomeanOracle is well-suited for deployment in decentralized finance protocols that require a trustworthy and efficient price oracle. Developers should consider the outlined features, internal functions, and security considerations when integrating GeomeanOracle into their projects.
