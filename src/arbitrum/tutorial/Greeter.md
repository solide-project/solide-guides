This tutorial for creating a cross-chain interaction between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) using Arbitrum's message passing system, specifically showcasing "retryable tickets." Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. **Setup:** The script initializes two wallets, one for L1 and another for L2, and deploys Greeter contracts on both layers.

2. **Contract Deployment:** Greeter contracts on L1 and L2 are deployed, each containing a different greeting message. The contracts are linked by setting each contract's counterparty address in their respective states.

3. **Greeting Update:** The script demonstrates how to update the greeting message on L2 by sending a message from L1. Gas parameters for the L1-to-L2 message are estimated, and the script provides an example of overriding these values if needed.

4. **Message Sending:** The updated greeting is sent to L2 as a retryable message from L1, including the calculated gas parameters and deposit values.

5. **Transaction Confirmation:** The script confirms the transaction on L1 and monitors the status of the L2 execution of the retryable message. It waits for the L2 retryable ticket to be either redeemed or failed.

6. **Result Display:** The final L2 greeting is displayed, reflecting the successful update.

This script demonstrates how to interact with Arbitrum's core bridge contracts, deploy contracts on both layers, and perform cross-chain communication using retryable tickets. It also provides insights into estimating gas parameters and handling L1-to-L2 message execution.
