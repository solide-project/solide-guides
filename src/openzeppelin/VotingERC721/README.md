## Overview
The smart contract named "VotingERC721" is an ERC721 token with added functionality to support voting on governance/DAO proposals. It extends the OpenZeppelin ERC721 and ERC721Votes contracts, implementing the EIP712 standard for structured data hashing and signing. This token allows token owners to participate in governance by voting on proposals using their token holdings. Additionally, it keeps track of voting power, which can be delegated to other addresses.

## Key Features
1. **ERC721 Compatibility:** VotingERC721 is an ERC721-compliant token, allowing for standard non-fungible token (NFT) functionality such as ownership transfer and querying token metadata.
   
2. **Voting Capability:** Token owners can use their holdings to vote on governance or DAO proposals, making this token suitable for participation in decentralized governance systems.

3. **Delegation of Votes:** Token holders can delegate their voting power to other addresses. Delegation can be done either directly through the `delegate` function or by providing a signature using the `delegateBySig` function.

4. **Vote Tracking:** The contract maintains a history of each account's vote power through checkpoints. This allows for transparency in voting power changes over time.

5. **Total Supply Transparency:** The contract has a preminted total supply, and there is no minting function. This design choice ensures that users can confidently know the future supply of the token, which is crucial for governance and voting scenarios.

6. **EIP712 Support:** The contract implements the EIP712 standard for structured data hashing and signing, providing a secure way to handle off-chain signatures for operations like delegation.

## Internal Functions
1. **_update:** Internal function used to update the ownership of a token. It is an override that combines functionality from both ERC721 and ERC721Votes contracts.

2. **_increaseBalance:** Internal function to increase the balance of an account. It is an override that combines functionality from both ERC721 and ERC721Votes contracts.

## Events
1. **DelegateChanged:** Emitted when an account changes its delegate.

2. **DelegateVotesChanged:** Emitted when a token transfer or delegate change results in changes to a delegate's number of votes.

## Security Considerations
1. **Delegation Security:** Users should exercise caution when delegating their votes, ensuring that they trust the delegatee. Malicious or untrustworthy delegates could potentially misuse delegated voting power.

2. **Signature Security:** The contract relies on signatures for certain operations. Users should be aware of the security implications related to private key management and signature verification.

3. **Preminted Supply:** The total supply is preminted, and there is no minting function. Developers and users should be aware of the fixed supply and plan accordingly.

4. **EIP712 Implementation:** While EIP712 provides secure off-chain signature verification, users should follow best practices for handling signatures to prevent replay attacks and other vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion
"VotingERC721" is a versatile ERC721 token that extends its functionality to support decentralized governance through voting. Its implementation follows best practices for transparency, security, and compatibility with existing standards. Users can leverage this token in various applications, including DAOs and governance systems. Developers should carefully consider security considerations and user education when deploying or interacting with this contract.
