# LandV3 Contract Documentation and Tutorial

## Overview

The `LandV3` contract is a critical component of The Sandbox's LAND system, operating on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract adheres to the ERC-721 standard, facilitating the creation and management of non-fungible virtual land tokens. In addition to standard ERC-721 features, the contract incorporates operator filtering functionality through the Operator Filterer.

## Key Features

### 1. ERC-721 Compliance
The contract complies with the ERC-721 standard, providing a set of functions and events for the creation, transfer, and management of unique virtual land tokens.

### 2. Operator Filtering
Utilizing the Operator Filterer, the contract enhances security by allowing controlled approvals for operators involved in token transfers. This feature provides an additional layer of control over token management.

### 3. Metadata URI Generation
The contract dynamically generates metadata URIs for each token based on its unique identifier, enabling easy retrieval of associated metadata.

## Internal Functions

### `name()`
- **Description:** Returns the name of the token contract.
- **Visibility:** External

### `symbol()`
- **Description:** Returns the symbol of the token contract.
- **Visibility:** External

### `uint2str(uint256 _i)`
- **Description:** Converts a `uint256` to its string representation.
- **Visibility:** Internal

### `tokenURI(uint256 id)`
- **Description:** Returns the URI of a specific token based on its ID.
- **Visibility:** Public

### `supportsInterface(bytes4 id)`
- **Description:** Checks if the contract supports a given interface.
- **Visibility:** External

### `register(address subscriptionOrRegistrantToCopy, bool subscribe)`
- **Description:** Allows the contract to register with the Operator Filterer Registry for subscription or copying a list.
- **Visibility:** External
- **Modifiers:** Only Admin

### `setOperatorRegistry(address registry)`
- **Description:** Sets the Operator Filterer Registry address.
- **Visibility:** External
- **Modifiers:** Only Admin

## Events

### `OperatorRegistrySet(address indexed registry)`
- **Description:** Emitted when the Operator Filterer Registry address is set.
- **Parameters:** `registry` - The address of the registry.

## Security Considerations

1. **Operator Filtering:** The contract employs operator filtering through the Operator Filterer, ensuring that only approved operators can perform certain token operations. This helps prevent unauthorized transfers and enhances the overall security of the LAND system.

## Conclusion

The `LandV3` contract is a foundational element within The Sandbox's virtual land ecosystem, providing a secure and standardized platform for the creation and management of unique non-fungible land tokens. Developers and users can leverage the contract's features to interact with virtual land assets on the Ethereum blockchain efficiently.
