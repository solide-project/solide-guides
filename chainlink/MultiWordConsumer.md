# Chainlink Smart Contract Documentation: MultiWordConsumer

## Overview

The `MultiWordConsumer` smart contract demonstrates the utilization of Chainlink's Request & Receive Data cycle to make an HTTP GET request to an external API from a smart contract and receive multiple responses in a single call. The contract inherits from ChainlinkClient, facilitating multi-variable or multi-word responses. This documentation provides a detailed guide on deploying, configuring, and interacting with the contract.

## Key Features

1. **Oracle Configuration:**
   - Initialization of LINK token and oracle addresses.
   - Assignment of the Chainlink job ID and fee.

    ```solidity
    constructor() ConfirmedOwner(msg.sender) {
        setChainlinkToken(0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789);
        setChainlinkOracle(0x6090149792dAAeE9D1D568c9f9a6F6B46AA29eFD);
        jobId = "53f9755920cd451a8fe46f5087468395";
        fee = (1 * LINK_DIVISIBILITY) / 10;
    }
    ```

2. **Requesting Multiple Parameters:**
   - Creation of a Chainlink request to fetch Ethereum (ETH) price against BTC, USD, and EUR in a single transaction.

    ```solidity
    function requestMultipleParameters() public {
        Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(
            jobId,
            address(this),
            this.fulfillMultipleParameters.selector
        );
        req.add(
            "urlBTC",
            "https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH&tsyms=BTC"
        );
        req.add("pathBTC", "BTC");
        req.add(
            "urlUSD",
            "https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH&tsyms=USD"
        );
        req.add("pathUSD", "USD");
        req.add(
            "urlEUR",
            "https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/price?fsym=ETH&tsyms=EUR"
        );
        req.add("pathEUR", "EUR");
        sendChainlinkRequest(req, fee);
    }
    ```

3. **Fulfilling Multiple Parameters:**
   - Handling the response from the Chainlink oracle, emitting an event, and updating state variables for BTC, USD, and EUR.

    ```solidity
    function fulfillMultipleParameters(
        bytes32 requestId,
        uint256 btcResponse,
        uint256 usdResponse,
        uint256 eurResponse
    ) public recordChainlinkFulfillment(requestId) {
        emit RequestMultipleFulfilled(
            requestId,
            btcResponse,
            usdResponse,
            eurResponse
        );
        btc = btcResponse;
        usd = usdResponse;
        eur = eurResponse;
    }
    ```

4. **Withdrawing LINK:**
   - Allowing the contract owner to withdraw LINK tokens.

    ```solidity
    function withdrawLink() public onlyOwner {
        LinkTokenInterface link = LinkTokenInterface(chainlinkTokenAddress());
        require(
            link.transfer(msg.sender, link.balanceOf(address(this))),
            "Unable to transfer"
        );
    }
    ```

## Internal Functions

- **`constructor()`:**
  - Initializes the contract by setting up Chainlink oracle parameters.

- **`requestMultipleParameters()`:**
  - Creates a Chainlink request to fetch ETH price against BTC, USD, and EUR in a single transaction.

- **`fulfillMultipleParameters()`:**
  - Handles the response from the Chainlink oracle, emitting an event, and updating state variables for BTC, USD, and EUR.

- **`withdrawLink()`:**
  - Allows the contract owner to withdraw LINK tokens.

## Events

- **`RequestMultipleFulfilled(bytes32 indexed requestId, uint256 btc, uint256 usd, uint256 eur)`:**
  - Emitted when the oracle response is received, providing the requestId and ETH prices against BTC, USD, and EUR.

## Security Considerations

- **Oracles and Data Sources:**
  - Ensure the reliability and security of the selected oracles and data sources.
  - Consider using multiple oracles for redundancy.

- **LINK Token Security:**
  - Safeguard the LINK token by managing access controls and ensuring proper withdrawal mechanisms.

- **Deployment Considerations:**
  - This contract is for educational purposes and is not audited. Exercise caution before deploying similar contracts in production.

## Conclusion

The `MultiWordConsumer` contract serves as an educational example for interacting with Chainlink oracles and handling multi-variable responses efficiently. It showcases the process of making a single HTTP GET request to an external API and receiving multiple responses in a smart contract. Users are encouraged to explore and modify the contract for learning purposes while exercising caution in production environments.
